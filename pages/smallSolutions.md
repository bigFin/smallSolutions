	- Scaling up a fleet of custom pedestrian traffic sensors with on-line analytics and ML tools on top @ #[[Avenue Intelligence]]
		- Deploying ultra low power sensors across the Canada
		- Clickhouse high performance OLAP
		- ML forecasting and anomaly detection
	- Building [[MAC üå± Modular Agriculture Controller]]
	  HVAC and lighting controls based on plant biofeedback
	  Advanced real time canopy segmentation from thermal camera
	- Ran the [[Entourage Health Corp]] R&D program including the tissue culture and chemistry laboratories. Unlocked high value production through insight from photobiology, irrigation, and hvac experiments where we used sensor arrays, thermal and viz imaging and cv, to rapidly experiment, investigate, and validate optimal operational parameters.
		- [[Analytical Chemistry Lab üß™ 2022]]
		- Built the [[Automated postharvest processing system üçÉ 2023]] - precision postharvest automation - optimising for maximum CO2 efflux
		- Built and commercialized [[Plantlet Finishing Chambers üåø 2021-2022]] aseptic acclimatisation of tissue cultures
		- [[Plant Tissue Culture Method Development üå±]] meristem tip dissection
		- Built and ran vertical farming experiments in [[Lab G - Photobiology 2019-2020]]
	- Developed a multi-channel LED array with some smart scheduling features enabling complex experiments and fault tolerant autonomous operation [[Prismatic - Tissue Culture Photobiology 2017]]. Co-authored research using the system to validate recipes generated using a genetic algorithm to determine optimal media composition and light spectra for plant tissue culture.
	- Developing a process control driven by real time monitoring of solvent saturation and particle morphology in extraction process [[Inline realtime spectroscopy]]
