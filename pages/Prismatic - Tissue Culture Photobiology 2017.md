- ## [](https://github.com/bigFin/Prismatic#what-is-prismatic) What is Prismatic?
- Prismatic is a modular, wifi programmable, multi-channel LED light that gives you precise control over ghthe the spectrum you give your plants. Connect with your phone or computer, the web-based scheduling system lets you create simple and advanced programs.
- I built Prismatic to optimize light spectrum for organogenesis and regeneration in tissue culture, but it can be used for any precision lighting, photobiology, specialty plant growth, or plant propagation situation.

- ### [](https://github.com/bigFin/Prismatic#how-is-prismatic-used) How is Prismatic used?
- Each Prismatic module can be independently programmed, try growing your plants under different conditions and see how they respond. Perform controlled experiments using the Central Composite Rotatable Design. Generate a response surface and find the optimum mixture of spectra. I then validate this using replicated studies.
